        <!-- I took a trip to my Country of origin in Colombia last spring to reassess my life. I was trying out
        new things stumbled across the webdesign. It was an interesting challenge that made me stop and think about how
        I do things -->
        I am a proactive go getter who is always looking for ways to improve myself . Learning how to programme is a
        rewarding experience that takes patience, practice
        and perservirance. My 10 week tech bootcamp course was an eye-opening experience that showed me all that is
        still to learn. I value the journey in all its peaks and valleys.
